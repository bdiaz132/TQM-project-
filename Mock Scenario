Mock Scenario

Our problem is not knowing what is done and what's not done
The solution we have deiced to do is to have better oranization with the tickets
We plan on having a drawer next to the computers that we will separate into sections to split up the different tickets
We will spilit the drawer into 4 parts new, late, beig worked on, and finished
We believe that by doing this we will know which computer is done, still being worked on, a new ticket, and late tickets
This solution will fix this evergrowing problem

Steps To Testing

The first step we will do to test this is do half the computers the old way and half the new way
The second step would be to go around and see how smoothly it is running
The thrid step would be to ask the workers how they like the new system
The fourth and final step would be if the solution goes smoothly implement the new system
