A new procedure that would work for the service desk and help at the very least aleviate our root cause is to have a better system for orginization in the desk. 
We have come up of a sorting method in the storage cabnet of completed and pending tickets to better help in the veryfying process. We also will have a section for outstanding or late tickets. 
We also think its a good idea to label the troubleshooting method the last technition was using and his status and progress on said method.
The procedure would work as follows:
1. Students would recieve tickets, document them, and put them in the area designated for pending tickets.
2. A student will take up a pending ticket and work through a troubleshooting process to find a solution to a problem. 
3. The process will be well documented for the next student to continue on, if a solution is being attempted, the last student will document the status of the soluton for the next student to pick up on.
4. If a solution appears successful, then it should be documented and verified by the same student or another student that knows what was done.
5. The verified computer will then be put in the designated area for completed tickets, and the customer will be verified on the status of his machine. 

For tickets stuck in limbo, a time should be put on tickets of a week or so and late tickets should always be prioritized. 
If a solution can't be found for outstanding tickets, the customer should be notified immediately for the next course of action.
